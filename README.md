# FireDasherEngine OLD

The code on this engine is super messy and horrible!!!! It is also very unfinished.  
I plan to rewrite this whole engine in Rust so you can look forward to that.

## Old Description:

Open Source 3D Game Engine

## Building

You need to uncompress Libraries/lib/assimp-vc143-mtd.7z  
Then you can build with Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition
